# Mail-Server

## Objective Goal:
The objective of this project is for students to set up a Mail Server using **Postfix** (for SMTP) and **Dovecot** (for IMAP/POP3), along with **Roundcube** as a webmail interface. The team will configure the mail server to handle incoming and outgoing email, set up proper DNS records, configure SSL/TLS for security, and test sending and receiving emails both locally and externally.

---

## Acceptance Criteria:

### 1. **Mail Server Configuration:**
   - **Postfix** should be able to send emails.
   - **Dovecot** should handle incoming mail via IMAP/POP3.
   - **Roundcube** should be accessible as a webmail client via the browser.

### 2. **Client Configuration:**
   - An **email client** (e.g., Thunderbird) should be able to send and receive emails via the configured mail server using **SMTP** and **IMAP/POP3**.

### 3. **Security:**
   - **SSL/TLS** encryption should be configured for both outgoing and incoming emails.
   - **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** DNS records should be configured and functional.

### 4. **Testing:**
   - Emails should be successfully sent to and received from external email addresses (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo).
   - The mail server should be reachable both locally and remotely (through email clients and Roundcube).

## Steps to Complete the Project:

### 1. **Postfix Configuration (SMTP):**
   - Install and configure Postfix for sending outgoing emails.
   - Ensure proper relay settings and mail queuing are configured.
   - Configure Postfix for secure communication using SSL/TLS.
   
### 2. **Dovecot Configuration (IMAP/POP3):**
   - Install and configure Dovecot for handling incoming email.
   - Enable IMAP and/or POP3 protocols for email retrieval.
   - Ensure secure connections using SSL/TLS for both incoming email protocols.
   
### 3. **Roundcube Webmail Interface:**
   - Install and configure Roundcube to provide a web-based email interface.
   - Configure Roundcube to communicate with Postfix (for sending emails) and Dovecot (for receiving emails).
   - Ensure that Roundcube is accessible via a web browser.
   
### 4. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Set up **SPF** records to specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails for your domain.
   - Configure **DKIM** to sign outgoing emails for email authenticity.
   - Set up **DMARC** to protect the domain from email spoofing.
   
### 5. **Testing and Troubleshooting:**
   - Test sending and receiving emails using external services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo).
   - Verify proper email delivery and handling using SMTP (Postfix) and IMAP/POP3 (Dovecot).
   - Use email clients like Thunderbird and webmail (Roundcube) to verify the system's functionality.
   - Perform security testing to ensure SSL/TLS encryption is working properly.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Postfix**: Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) for sending emails.
- **Dovecot**: Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) for receiving emails via IMAP and POP3.
- **Roundcube**: Webmail client for accessing emails via a browser.
- **SSL/TLS**: For securing email communications.
- **SPF, DKIM, DMARC**: For securing email authentication and ensuring email authenticity.

---

## Installation Steps (High-Level Overview):
1. Install and configure **Postfix** for outgoing email.
2. Install and configure **Dovecot** for incoming email.
3. Install **Roundcube** for webmail access.
4. Set up **SSL/TLS** certificates for encrypted email communication.
5. Configure **DNS records** for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
6. Test and verify email communication both locally and externally.

---

## Testing Guidelines:
- Ensure that emails sent from the server can be received by external email services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo).
- Verify that incoming emails are properly received using IMAP/POP3 protocols.
- Use **Thunderbird** or another email client to test sending and receiving emails via SMTP and IMAP/POP3.
- Test **Roundcube** for accessing and sending emails through the browser.

## Conclusion:
By completing this project, students will have set up a fully functioning mail server using **Postfix**, **Dovecot**, and **Roundcube**. The server will be configured with secure protocols (SSL/TLS) and will be able to send and receive emails both locally and externally. Additionally, DNS records such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC will be configured to ensure email security and authenticity.
